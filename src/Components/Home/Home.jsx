          <h2>Education Bursary</h2>
          <p>
            In October 2015, the Government of Rwanda gave the mandate of
            management of studentsâ€™ loans and bursaries to BRD in compliance
            with the provisions of Law No 44/2015 of 14/09/2015 governing
            student loans and bursaries in Rwanda. This role was previously
            undertaken by the Ministry of Education. <br /> The Bank will play
            an important role in increasing access and improving quality of both
            basic and tertiary education. This will be achieved through
            investments in Education projects, Education savings program and
            efficient management of student loan and bursary schemes.
